# Key Logger in C++

This repository contains a simple key logger implemented in C++.

## Introduction

A key logger is a program that records the keystrokes on a computer without the user's knowledge. This C++ implementation captures keystrokes and logs them for analysis.

## Usage

To use this key logger, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Locate the following line of code:

   ```cpp
   ofstream write("path/to/stored/key/filename.txt", ios::app);
3. Change "path/to/stored/key/filename.txt" to the desired file path where you want to store the logged keystrokes.
4. Compile the file using a C++ compiler.
5. Run the compiled executable.
6. The key logger will start capturing keystrokes in the background.

## Disclaimer

Please use this key logger responsibly and only on your own devices or with explicit permission from the device owner. Unauthorized use may violate privacy laws.
